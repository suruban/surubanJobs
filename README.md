## ðŸ’¼ Job Search Application

I have developed a job search application using React Native and Expo. This app helps users find job opportunities efficiently with an intuitive interface and powerful features.

### Key Features:
- **Job Listings:** Browse through a wide range of job listings.
- **Search & Filters:** Easily search and filter jobs based on location, industry, and more.
- **User Profiles:** Create and manage profiles to save job preferences and applications.
- **Notifications:** Receive real-time updates on job matches and application status.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this project!
